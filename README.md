### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a long-time C# coder now enjoying learning Python as I build a bunch of new projects. Being disabled, my coding these days is focused on projects I want to doâ€”things that are fun and keep me busyâ€”and I do a lot of AI projects for fun. I'll add some of my favorite repos later. I also love 3D printing, and a lot of my projects now seek to combine my coding, AI, and 3D printing hobbies. I have some things I'm building that I'm excited to share as soon as they're in a state I feel comfortable sharing.
